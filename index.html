              , and I&#39;m a newly certified amateur radio operator. I first
              learned about the hobby from a family relative where I grew
              increasingly appealed.<br />
              <br />
              Something about amateur radio&#39;s simplicity paired with its
              complexity sparked my curiosity. At first, I wondered &quot;what
              is this amateur radio one speaks of.&quot; With the growth of the
              internet, this was not a difficult question to answer.&nbsp;

              I began to invest time and research towards the hobby. The more I
              learned, the more I realized that someone like me could break into
              the hobby.<br />
              <br />
              Unlike many current operators, I am not a 50 year old guy. Like
              how many operators began, I&#39;m 15. My young age is a driving
              force towards constantly learning, because there&#39;s a lot I
              don&#39;t know that I want to know. This very driving force
              allowed me to self study for a couple months to obtain my Basic
              qualification in Canada.

              In 2024, I officially became certified as a true Canadian amateur
              radio operator with Basic with Honours. Currently, most of my time
              on frequencies are spent listening to conversations made in my
              local city: Regina, SK.

            Ever since grade 3, I&#39;ve been a programmer. It began with a
            simple book where I discovered HTML. This grew into learning CSS,
            which led to JavaScript, which eventually led to Python, C++, and
            multiple Node.js frameworks.
